# Compiler for Mini-python

You must submit an tarball containing
- the sources of your compiler;
- a short report;
- possibly other files, e.g. test files of your own.

You don't have to read and understand the parser, but you have to read and understand the abstract syntax trees  (ast.ml) . They are two kinds of syntax trees:
- parsed trees = output of the parser = input of the type checker
- typed trees = output of the type checker = input of the compiler
